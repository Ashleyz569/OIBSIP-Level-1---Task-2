                <br><span>Ashley Evangeline George</span></h1>
            <p>I am a 20-year-old Computer Science Engineering student who is passionate about various things. When I'm not busy studying, you can find me running marathons or practicing basic calisthenics skills. I also have a creative side, and I love to draw cartoons in my free time. In addition, I am a scriptwriter and video editor for my college's theatre and production club, Raagabhinaya. I am also a part of the social media team in the Software development club, where I get to put my creativity and technical skills to good use. As an aspirant web developer, I am always looking to learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS. I'm also interested in exploring Android development and excited to see where this journey takes me.</p>
